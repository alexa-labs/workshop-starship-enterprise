# Building the Starship Enterprise Computer Today

Nearly every science fiction story has shown us that voice interfaces are the future. This workshop will show you how to make that science fiction a reality. Building this skill will teach you the advanced topics required for creating compelling voice interfaces. You will learn how to build Alexa skills, how to design conversational experiences, and how to amplify your brand and monetize your best content.

A user opens the skill and selects what area of the space ship they would like to command. Alexa responds to their commands accordingly, updating displays and featuring advanced SSML design and Amazon Polly.
